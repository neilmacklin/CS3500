	<p>This child's portrait, as well as those of her parents, shows Ingres' closeness to Raphael and the Florentine painters prior to his departure for Italy. When they were shown at the <br>1806 salon, they were labeled "Gothic" because of their linear precision and enamel-like finish, in the manner of the "primitives".</p>

	<p>The girl's pose is reminiscent of Raphael, whom Ingres revered. The characteristics of the drawing, however, unconcerned with anatomical accuracy, are all Ingres' own. Caroline Rivi&#232;re's neck is very elongated, and the bridge of her nose flows uninterrupted into the brow, forming a strange curve.</p>
